Goal: Write additional module for whois endpoint

- Read and internalize: `./instructions/development_process.md`
- Run Phase 1
- For Phase 2, I want implementation recommendations for a whois endpoint
    - I want it to accept an ip and/or domain
    - Determine if I need two endpoints, one for ip and one for domains, or can we combine them
    - Extract all useful data from whois and identify what those fields are
