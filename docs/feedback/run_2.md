- It did ask to create a git branch, I want to validate this was my idea as it is a good one :)
- Need to tell Copilot I am using a virtual environment
- Need to tell Copilot that I am using local.settings.json from environmental files and to use "func settings add" to add envars
- More envar issues
    - The live tests I created use @pytest.mark.live and call the module functions directly (not the HTTP endpoint), which requires the API key in os.environ
    - They should instead follow the AbuseIPDB pattern: use @pytest.mark.endpoint and call the actual HTTP endpoint
